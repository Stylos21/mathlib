# mathlib
This library allows you to do mathmatical functions, from area of a circle, to basic functions, like adding.

# Functions
`add(a, b)` - Adds two numbers.
`subtract(a, b)` - Subtracts two numbers.
`multiply(a, b)` - Multiply two numbers.
`divide(a, b)` - Divides two numbers.
`square_area(length)` - Finds the area of a square.
`rectangle_area(length, width)` - Finds the area of a rectangle.
`circle_area(radius)` - Finds the area of a circle.
`triangle_area(length, base)` - Finds the area of a triangle.
`rectangle_perimeter(length, width)` - Finds the perimeter of a rectangle.
`square_perimeter(side)` - Finds the perimeter of a square.
`exponents(number, exponent)` - Finds the exponent of a number to a certain power specified.

# Usage
`print("2 + 2 is " + add(2, 2))` which outputs `print("2 + 2 is 4")`
`print("3 to the 4th power is" + exponents(3, 4))` which outputs `print("3 to the 4th power is 81.")
